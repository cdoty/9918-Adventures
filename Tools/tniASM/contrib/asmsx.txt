asMSX compatibility layer for tniASM v1.0


This compatibility layer has the main intention of showing the internals of 
the asMSX built-in macros that would make things somewhat more readable for 
the starting assembly developer. However, many of those macros are basically 
very simple things in the background.


Unfortunately asMSX sources can't be used as input for the compatibility 
layer without some find and replace actions:

- local labels
  asMSX uses '@@' as prefix for a local label, whereas tniASM uses '.'.
- hexadecimal notation
  asMSX supports '#' as prefix for a hexadecimal value. This should be '$'.
- comments
  asMSX supports C style comments and block comments. tniASM only supports 
  C style block comments. Block comments between '{' and '}' should be either 
  '/;' and '\;' or '/*' and '*/'. '//' comments should always become ';'.


The compatibility layer has a few built-in macros which are defined to allow 
assembling the source, but won't do anything apart from printing a message. 
Some may get support in the future:

- REPT and ENDR
  source repeats are unsupported at this time, but they may get supported.
- .RANDOM
- .PRINT
- .PRINTDEC
- .PRINTHEX
- .PRINTFIX
- .WAV


The compatibility layer has support for the megaroms and cassette file 
generation, but they still need to be tested.

Compiling the asMSX source can be done by executing the following on the 
commandline:

tniasm asmsx <asMSX source>
