The test Pencil II system was created using a Colecovision, with a modified Pencil II BIOS, and a Super Game Module(SGM). See [here](https://atariage.com/forums/topic/310073-coleco-pencil-2-modification/?do=findComment&comment=4608647) for the details.
The Super Game Module is needed because the Colecovision only has 1k of RAM compared to the 2k on the Pencil II.
