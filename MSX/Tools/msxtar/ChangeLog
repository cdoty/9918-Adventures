	* Extract commands can now extract a list of single
	  files/subdirs as listed on the command line
	  Current implementation is rather restricted in its handling
	  of preceding './' or '/' directory paths
	  it doesn't (correctly) work if you specify them.
	  and using '\' instead of '/' is not handled correctly neither 
	  for the moment

2004-07-15 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>

2004-07-14 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>

2004-07-06 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>

	  during am image creation, no partition support yet...
	  But good enough for 'normal' usage :-)
