* Introduction

`msxtar' saves many files together into a single diskimage , and can
retrieve and update individual files from the image.  It includes FAT16
support, the ability to access IDE-HD image partitions, automatic disk
compression/decompression.

msxtar generic options and descriptions are derived from GNU tar.

See file `COPYING' for copying conditions.
See file `INSTALL' for compilation and installation instructions.
See file `NEWS' for a list of major changes in the current release.
See file `THANKS' for a list of contributors.

** gzip and bzip2.

msxtar uses the gzip and bzip2 programs to read and write compressed
archives.  If you don't have these programs already, you need to
install them.  Their sources can be found at:

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2/


* Bug reporting.

Send bug reports to <dhran@pi.be>.  A bug report should contain
an adequate description of the problem, your input, what you expected,
what you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but they only
describe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to infer.
If needed, submit actual data files with your report.  Small data files
are preferred.  Big files may sometimes be necessary, but do not send them
to the report address; rather take special arrangement with the maintainer.

Your feedback will help us to make a better and more portable package.
Consider documentation errors as bugs, and report them as such.  If you
develop anything pertaining to `msxtar' or have suggestions, let us know
and share your findings by writing to <dhran@pi.be>.
