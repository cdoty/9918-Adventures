This is a custom version of MAME that adds a hrhmbrew (High Rate DVD homebrew) driver.  
The driver removes the need for the chd file, containing questionable videos.  
The hrhmbrew driver doesn't patch the ROM, and uses a single rom image, rather than a split one.  
The modified source files are included.  
  
You will need nichidvd.zip and 11.ic51 and gal16v8h.020 from tsuwaku.zip. The need to be place in mame\roms\hrhmbrew.  
Roms 3.ic40 and 4.ic41 are empty files padded to 512k.
