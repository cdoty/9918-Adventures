* The project builds a segment file, which can be loaded as a local file using the NABU internet adapter.  
* Currently you will need a modified version of MAME and the NABU internet adapter, from [nabu.ca](https://nabu.ca/).  
* The launch.json file will have to be modified with the path to the modified version of MAME.
